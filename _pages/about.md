Hello! This is <strong>Cha-nyeong Cho’s</strong> Academic Page.

・I completed my undergraduate studies in Mechanical Systems Engineering in Japan, where I focused on robotics and control systems.

・Through my experiences in Korea, Japan, and the United States, I have come to view robotics not only as technology, but as a bridge that connects people and understanding.

・I am currently <strong>applying for Ph.D. programs in the United States,</strong> exploring how robots can understand and support people.


My Research Interest
======
My research interests lie in human–robot interaction, reinforcement learning, and assistive robotics, with a focus on developing emotionally responsive systems that enhance daily living and caregiving.
