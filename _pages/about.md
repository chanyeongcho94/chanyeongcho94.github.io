Hello! This is <strong>Cha-nyeong Cho’s</strong> Academic Page.

・I received my B.S. degree in Mechanical Systems Engineering from Shinshu University, Japan, where I specialized in robotics and control systems, working under the supervision of [Prof. Kimitoshi Yamazaki](https://www.rs.mech.tohoku.ac.jp/?page_id=168) and [Asst. Prof. Yang Tian.](https://soar-rd.shinshu-u.ac.jp/search/detail.html?systemId=jFfhbUkh&lang=en&st=researcher)

・I spent one year at California State University, Sacramento, as an exchange student, studying robotic systems and control with [Asst. Prof. Rohollah Moghadam.](https://www.csus.edu/faculty/m/moghadam/)

・I am currently <strong>applying for Ph.D. programs in the United States,</strong> exploring how robots can understand and support people.


My Research Interest
======
My research interests lie in human–robot interaction, reinforcement learning, and assistive robotics, with a focus on developing emotionally responsive systems that enhance daily living and caregiving.

My goal is to help create a society where robots naturally support older adults, people with disabilities, and their families in daily life.
